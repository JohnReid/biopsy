The information content of various (gapped) PWMs. The background is modeled as a uniform 0-order Markov model. The dominant base at each position has a
frequency of .85 and the other bases have frequencies of .05. The effects of PWMs that are their own reverse complements can be seen.
How the gap affects the information content differently depending on the first order entropy of the PWM is also shown.
